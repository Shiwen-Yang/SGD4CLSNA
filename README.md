# Stochastic Gradient Descent Methods and Uncertainty Quantification in Extended CLSNA Models

This repository supports the study "Stochastic Gradient Descent Methods and Uncertainty Quantification in Extended CLSNA Models".

## Code Overview

- `simulation/`: Features `main.ipynb` for simulations with synthetic data, demonstrating the application of stochastic gradient descent in network analysis.

- `X/207/`: Contains scripts for analyzing Twitter congressional hashtag networks with 207 nodes. These nodes were present throughout the entire study period.

- `X/505/`: Contains scripts for analyzing the same Twitter congressional hashtag networks, but includes all nodes identified during the study.
